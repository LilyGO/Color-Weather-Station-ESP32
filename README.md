  Made on ESP32. 
  
  Arduino is necessary for the firmware. You also need to register for Wunderground (for free, but in English, detailed instructions in the folder with the library (also in English, truth.) The libraries are modified to use ESP32 and the screen from TTGO.
  
  Suitable for almost any boards on ESP32 and LED screens on controllers compatible with ILI9341.
